## User Accounts


- Add an `Email` and `Password` field to the `Create` view for the `AccountController`

- Add an `ApplicationUser` as a property to `Account`

- Create an `ApplicationUser` when a new `Account` is created.

- Add a `ResetPassword` view for the `AccountController`

- Add a property of the type bool to the `ApplicationUser` to check if it is their first time signing in

- Redirect the `ApplicationUser` to the `ResetPassword` view if it is their first time signing in, so they can reset the password their teacher assigned them.
